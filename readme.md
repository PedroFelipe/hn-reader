# Welcome

Thank you for taking your time and agreeing to take this challenge as part of our recruitment process. We understand that sometimes it can be hard to find enough time to dedicate yourself properly to this type of activity, so if for any reason you have problems related to it let us know and communicate properly what you've done and what you were still planning to do if you had more time. 

The challenge is to build _YOUR OWN IMPLEMENTATION_ of the (Hacker News website)[https://news.ycombinator.com/]. For doing so, you are encouraged to consume data from the open HN api - https://github.com/HackerNews/API, but this is not a requirement. This compressed folder has a git repository initialized. You are supposed to version your files and describe your changes using git. 

Besides using git, there are no constrains regarding technologies/tools, so you are free to choose whatever stack you feel that suite the challenge. You are also free to choose the functionalities of the original HN website you are going to implement. You're probably not going to be able to implement all features there, so we recommend you focus on the main ones. 

The application code will be reviewed and the application itself will be tested on a high-end mobile device.

You don't have to worry with the back-end implementation. When testing we'll make sure we serve the files on this repository properly. 

Imagine that you are already working at Werkspot, we want to build an improved version of HN and you were assigned the task to start it's front-end implementation.

From the moment we send you this repository, you have 48 hours to work on it.

Feel free to ask us any questions and have fun!
